# User Rules Index

> KISS, YAGNI, DRY + Karpathy AI 개발 4원칙 준수. 상세 규칙은 `~/.gemini/rules/` 참조.
>
> 1. **KISS** — Keep It Simple, Stupid. 복잡하게 하지 말고 간단하게
> 2. **YAGNI** — You Aren't Gonna Need It. 지금 필요 없는 건 만들지 마
> 3. **DRY** — Don't Repeat Yourself. 같은 코드를 반복하지 마
> 4. **Think Before Coding** — 가정 명시, 모호하면 물어보기
> 5. **Simplicity First** — 요청한 것만, 과도한 추상화 금지
> 6. **Surgical Changes** — 필요한 것만 건드림, 기존 스타일 유지
> 7. **Goal-Driven Execution** — 검증 가능한 목표로 변환, TDD 루프

<!-- context7 -->
Use the `ctx7` CLI to fetch current documentation whenever the user asks about a library, framework, SDK, API, CLI tool, or cloud service — even well-known ones like React, Next.js, Prisma, Express, Tailwind, Django, or Spring Boot. This includes API syntax, configuration, version migration, porting code between libraries, platforms, or SQL dialects, library-specific debugging, setup instructions, and CLI tool usage. Use even when you think you know the answer — your training data may not reflect recent changes. Prefer this over web search for library docs.

Do not use for: refactoring, debugging, or reviewing code that does not depend on a library or platform API, or general programming concepts.

## Steps

1. Resolve library: `npx ctx7@latest library <name> "<what to look up>"` — use the official library name with proper punctuation (e.g., "Next.js" not "nextjs", "Customer.io" not "customerio", "Three.js" not "threejs")
2. Pick the best match (ID format: `/org/project`) by: exact name match, description relevance, code snippet count, source reputation (High/Medium preferred), and benchmark score (higher is better). If results don't look right, try alternate names or queries (e.g., "next.js" not "nextjs", or rephrase the question)
3. Fetch docs: `npx ctx7@latest docs <libraryId> "<what to look up>"` — run a separate `docs` command per distinct concept if the question spans multiple topics, unless it's about how they interact
4. Answer using the fetched documentation

You MUST call `library` first to get a valid ID unless the user provides one directly in `/org/project` format. Be specific about what to look up in the library's documentation — specific and detailed queries return better results than vague single words, but keep each query to a single concept unless the question is about how concepts interact; combined multi-topic queries dilute ranking and return shallow results for each topic. Do not run more than 3 commands per question. Do not include sensitive information (API keys, passwords, credentials) in queries.

For version-specific docs, use `/org/project/version` from the `library` output (e.g., `/vercel/next.js/v16.2.9`).

If a command fails with a quota error, inform the user and suggest `npx ctx7@latest login` or setting `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` env var for higher limits. Do not silently fall back to training data.
